# How to start a GitHub repo for your research project

This guide will help you to start your new research project on GitHub. It will explain the central parts for a solid foundation from which others can easily contribute to your project or are able to reuse your results. There is no perfect way of setting up a new repository so I will try to provide examples for cases where certain steps/parts are important. Please feel free to contribute to the collection and resources of this repository.
